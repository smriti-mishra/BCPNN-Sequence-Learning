# Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network

A mechanism to learn sequences with the BCPNN in Python3

This is a part of the project with Dr. Pawel Herman at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden. (Between January 2019 to June 2020)

- How we process thoughts in the brain and why people lose memory.
- Analysis of overlapping sequences in the brain.
- Analysis of behaviour of non-orthogonal sequences as well as implemented representation and sequential overlapping on the BCPNN model. 
- Analysis that the proposed network model will be able to encode and reproduce temporal aspects of the input, and offers internal control of the recall dynamics by gain modulation.
